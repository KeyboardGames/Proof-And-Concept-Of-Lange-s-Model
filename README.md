## What Is The Lange Model?
> "The Lange model (or Lange–Lerner theorem) is a neoclassical economic model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the means of
> production and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving economic equilibrium and Pareto efficiency. In this model, the state
> owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a
> public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy
> under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price
> equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency." —[Wikipedia, Lange Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_model)

This definition given by Wikipedia is a pretty good summary of what the Lange Model is, although a problem of this model is the need to calculate gigantic 
quanitities of calculations, ableit simple calculations. This problem was argued at the time (1930s) by prominent economist Friedrich Hayek against the 
Lange Model. A couple of years have passed since the 1930s although, with the introduction of technology that can do the task of calculating simple 
equations repetiviely in a very short amount of time. This thought of using computers to carry-out this process was first recommended by Oskar Lange in 
a piece published in 1965, the same year he died sadly. Although, he didn't recommend the entire economy to be "decentralized" (in a way) and be automated 
entirely, but that computers be used as an instrument for economists to use to plan the economy.
