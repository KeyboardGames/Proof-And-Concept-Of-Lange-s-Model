## What Is The Lange Model?
> "The Lange model (or Lange–Lerner theorem) is a neoclassical economic model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the means of
> production and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving economic equilibrium and Pareto efficiency. In this model, the state
> owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a
> public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy
> under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price
> equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency." —[Wikipedia, Lange Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_model)

This definition given by Wikipedia is a pretty good summary of what the Lange Model is, although I'd like to add that profits made under this system are divided socially. 

## Context
A problem of this model is the need to calculate gigantic quanitities of calculations, ableit simple calculations. This problem was argued at the time 
(1930s) by prominent economist Friedrich Hayek against the Lange Model. A couple of years have passed since the 1930s although, with the introduction of 
technology that can do the task of calculating simple equations repetiviely in a very short amount of time. This thought of using computers to carry-out 
this process was first recommended by Oskar Lange in a piece published in 1965, the same year he died sadly. Although, he didn't recommend the entire 
economy to be "decentralized" (in a way) and be automated entirely, but that computers be used as an instrument for economists to use to plan the economy.

## Expaning Upon The Model
###Economic Monitoring
To expand upon the idea of using computers as tools for the economy, I looked at the famous socialist Chilean project from the early 70's called "Project 
Cybersyn". Now, I believe that Project Cybersyn wouldn't have worked as apparently it was supposed to run a full-simulation of the Chilean economy and also 
it was the 70's in Chile. One thing I do like though about this project was how the economy would still be planned and not fully automated as there was 
still human input, as in human monitoring. To not have the economy be fully-automated and to not have the use of "economic-automation" be painfully slow, 
we could use human monitoring of prices suggested by the computers to have the economy still be planned, and at least maintained by humans.
###Supply
Also for this model to work, technology for tracking supply available would be needed. The supply tracked wouldn't have to be so specific, but the less 
rounded data there is, the better essentially. The USSR was able to do this, although I haven't really looked too much into that so far.
###Economic Plans
To launch economic plans within this system, two known routes can be taken. One is to use the framework of the market to 
launch a plan (for example: having a plan to lower the amount of nuclear energy used and increase the amount of wind energy can be done by slowly adjusting 
the amount of nuclear energy and wind energy into the market until wanted levels are seen). The second route would be to change prices manually, although 
this would affect equilibrium.
###Tackling Inflation
Inflation could be tackled by reinvesting some of the profits that would've been divided socially to be used to increase the quality of an item's marginal cost.
###Government Funding
Taxes would be needed and/or a percentage of the social dividend to be taken.
###Trading
No monetary exchanges for items could happen when trading with other countries, so trading would be very traditionalistic.
