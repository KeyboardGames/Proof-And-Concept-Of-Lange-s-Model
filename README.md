## What Is The Lange Model?
> "The Lange model (or Lange–Lerner theorem) is a neoclassical economic model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the means of
> production and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving economic equilibrium and Pareto efficiency. In this model, the state
> owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a
> public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy
> under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price
> equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency."
